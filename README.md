- 👋 Hey there, I’m @ericktreichel , a civil engineer and developer and I'm just getting started here!
- 👀 I’m (truly and deeply) interested in learning about programming, IT and technology in general, as well as economics and social issues/matters.
- 💡 I strongly believe that technology, combined with people interested in the collective, is our best chance to transform the world and people's lives for the better.
- 🐥 I've already learned JavaScript, Typescript, and Python for programming, as well as SQL and MongoDB for data persistence.
- ⚛ So far, I've worked with frameworks like Vue, Nuxt, and Nestjs for JS/TS, and Flask for Python.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm dedicated to honing my skills in JS and TS. I'm also starting to dive into Java.
- 📫 You can reach me by e-mail at erickfili25@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericktreichel.
- 🚀 I'm highly motivated to learn and grow as a developer, with the aim of creating (and help others to create) something meaningful for the world and the people in it. 🌎

  Formado em Engenharia Civil Costeira pela Universidade Federal do Rio Grande, e atualmente me desenvolvo na área de TI, sendo Pós-graduado em Engenharia de Software.
