- 👋 Hi there, I’m @ericktreichel and I'm just starting my stuff here!
- ➡ I'm not adding new stuff here because I'm working mostly on private repos from my employer. 
- 👀 I’m (truly and deeply) interested in learning about programming, IT and technology in general.
- 🐥 I've learned (so far) JavaScript, Typescript and Python for programming; SQL and MongoDB for data persistence.
- ⚛ Frameworks that I've worked so far: Vue, Nuxt and Nestjs for JS/TS and Flask for Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing mostly JS and TS.
- 📫 How to reach me: by e-mail: (erickfili25@gmail.com) and Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericktreichel/).
- 🚀 I'm very motivated to learn and grow as a developer, and then be able to do something meaningful for the world (and the people in it) in the future. 🌎

  Sou formado em Engenharia Civil Costeira pela Universidade Federal do Rio Grande, e atualmente me desenvolvo na área de TI.
